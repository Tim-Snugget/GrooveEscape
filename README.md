# GROOVE ESCAPE
## [The build link is right here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VytdUj_ar-XWkAGI9eiaPXuJNWtmwueh/view?usp=share_link)

This project is our first project on Unreal using Blueprints. The developers were :
- **Marc Olivier Lauret** _alias_ [@Marc-olivierLAURET](https://github.com/Marc-olivierLAURET)
- **Fabien Cheung Lim Yen** _alias_ [@Fistoflex](https://github.com/Fistoflex)
- **Timothé Fertin** _alias_ [@Tim-Snugget](https://github.com/Tim-Snugget)

## THE GAME
Our game is a little platformer. Originally, the player had to beat the music, because we wanted to link the music to gameplay elements so the player had to follow the rythm of it (the BPM) to pass certain obstacles, but due to a certain lack of time and talent (*first game using blueprint notably*) we weren't able to implement such feature.  
Thus our little game is a platformer with a synthwave/emissive strong inspiration, with elements doing a punch scaling animation with a rythm that can be scaled to a BPM!

## CLONING AND WORKING ON THE GAME
Every Assets are in the gitignore to not pollute our repositories and protect the authenticity of the asset builders.  
To be able to correctly work on the project, you have to add each of them with the project. Then it should work... almost
I (Tim) had to customize SCL_Casual01 to link its material to the material functions from Material Function Collection, so here's a link to my [Custom SCK_Casual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wvZDgIizKzQjtH20ZtSyxLXvD4wIUD1b/view?usp=share_link) (only works with Mat Func Collection in the project obviously)
